## Realme Narzo N61 Overview
### Design and Display
The Realme Narzo N61 is basically the same phone as the Realme C61. This reigns true in terms of design and even their promotional materials. But that is a good thing though, because this phone also features Realme’s ArmorShell protection. It is a combination of multiple things like metal build and frame, reinforced glass, coated protection film, shock-absorbing internals, silicone strips and foams, etc. All this adds to the durability of the phone and as a result, it is TÜV Rheinland certified for high reliability. It also comes with IP54 water and dust resistance.
On the front, the phone has a 6.74-inch display with HD+ resolution. The company shies away from mentioning the panel type of the Realme Narzo N61. This leads us to believe that it is a TFT LCD, which is a cheaper panel option commonly seen in this price range. Other than that, the screen is capable of a 90Hz refresh rate, a 180Hz touch sampling rate, and a peak brightness of up to 560 nits.
### Performance and Software
The primary driver on the Realme Narzo N61 is the UNISOC T612 chipset. It is a relatively low-powered silicon that comes in a 12nm fabrication. Furthermore, the processor has eight cores, clocks in at 1.8 GHz, and scores over 250,000 on AnTuTu. Meanwhile, the phone is available in two configurations: 4GB + 64GB, and 6GB + 128GB. It also allows you to expand the memory and storage by up to 6GB and 2TB via software and MicroSD card respectively.
In terms of software, the phone boots on the Realme UI based on Android 14. The company ensures that it will offer a lag-free experience for four years. The Realme Narzo N61 also comes with AI Boost Engine that smoothens the performance and improves the frame rate during demanding activities like gaming and multitasking. It also comes with Mini Capsule 2.0 which is Apple’s Dynamic Island knock-off and Rainwater Smart Touch that improves touch recognition even when your hands or screen is wet.
### Camera and the rest
Optics-wise, you get a 32MP primary shooter and a 5MP selfie camera. There is also an auxiliary lens on the back. However, its purpose has not been stated. It is likely a dummy unit just for show. In the tank, the Realme Narzo N61 packs a 5,000 mAh battery that supports moderate 10W charging. For wireless connectivity, it has dual SIM, 4G LTE, dual-band WiFi, and Bluetooth v5.0. On the other hand, for wired connections, the phone has a USB Type-C port as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack.

## Vivo Y19s Overview
The Vivo Y19s is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers a decent blend of performance and features. Powered by a capable processor and backed by ample RAM and storage, it delivers smooth multitasking and ample space for apps and media. The device boasts a vibrant display that brings content to life, while the long-lasting battery ensures you stay connected throughout the day. The Y19s also captures impressive photos and videos, thanks to its versatile camera setup.
### Design and Display
It is more accurate to refer to it as a follow-up to the Y17s, despite the name giving the impression that it is associated with the Y19. Therefore, in terms of design, the phone is sleek, with rounded corners, and seems to have a matte or slightly shimmering finish. Additionally, the phone features two rear cameras that are positioned vertically in an oval-shaped camera module.
This smartphone features a 6.68" LCD panel on the front that has a refresh rate of 90 Hz and a maximum brightness of 1000 nits. It also has an IP64 rating, which makes it dust-tight and provides rudimentary water protection, and a drop-resistant design.  

### Performance
The Vivo Y19s' internal components include a Mali-G57 GPU and a Unisoc T612 chipset, which is based on a 12nm technology and has two Cortex-A75 cores and six A55 cores operating at 1.8GHz.
Additionally, this processor comes with 128 GB of eMMC 5.1 storage and up to 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM. The card tray can hold two nano-SIMs and a microSD, which is a plus, even though none of that is particularly intriguing.
For a phone of this small, the Vivo Y19s' remarkable 5,500mAh battery is amazing. The battery charges at a modest 15W, though. It should survive for a long time even after four years of use if you charge it once a day, as it is rated to retain at least 80% of its original capacity after 1,460 cycles.  

### Camera and the rest
Regarding the camera, it has a 50MP sensor on the back. The selfie camera, which has a 5MP resolution, is located inside a punch hole. Additionally, the camera island has an RGB LED ring that may be utilized for notifications or to give some flair to music.
Additionally, FuntouchOS 14, which is based on Android 14, is released with the Vivo Y19s. It has stereo speakers, and the manufacturer says you can turn up the volume to 300 percent in loud settings. This is probably just a marketing ploy. A 3.5mm headphone jack is also located at the bottom of this smartphone.

## HMD Crest: A Versatile Mid-Range Smartphone for 2024
### Design and Display
The HMD Crest brings a sleek and modern design with a focus on durability and functionality. Sporting a well-constructed body, the device features dimensions of 163.9 x 76.4 x 8.4 mm and a solid weight of 205g, making it comfortable to hold while still feeling premium. The standout feature of the Crest is its large 6.67-inch OLED display, offering a crisp 1080 x 2400 pixel resolution with a 20:9 aspect ratio. The vibrant OLED panel provides deep blacks, excellent contrast, and sharp details, while the high screen-to-body ratio ensures an immersive viewing experience. With the added benefit of a 395 ppi density, the Crest excels at media consumption, making it a great option for those who enjoy watching videos or playing games on their device.
### Performance
Powering the HMD Crest is the Unisoc T760 chipset, built on a 6nm process, and paired with an octa-core CPU configuration (1x Cortex-A76 at 2.2GHz, 3x Cortex-A76, and 4x Cortex-A55). This setup delivers smooth performance across most day-to-day tasks, such as browsing, social media, and gaming. The device is equipped with 6GB of RAM, making multitasking seamless and efficient. For internal storage, users get 128GB, which can be expanded via the microSD slot (using a shared SIM slot), offering flexibility for those who need extra space for apps and media.
Running on Android 14, the device provides a clean and responsive user interface, optimized for performance and ease of use. The Mali-G57 GPU ensures decent graphics rendering, making the device capable of handling casual gaming and media playback with ease.
### Camera
The HMD Crest is equipped with a dual-camera setup, featuring a 50MP wide-angle primary sensor that delivers clear, detailed photos in most lighting conditions, supported by a 2MP depth sensor for bokeh effects in portrait shots. The camera system includes features like LED flash and HDR, enhancing the photo quality in diverse environments. The rear camera setup is capable of recording 1080p videos at 30fps, providing solid video quality for daily use. On the front, a 50MP selfie camera ensures sharp and vibrant self-portraits, supported by video capabilities, making it perfect for video calls or content creation.
### Battery, Charging, and Connectivity
The HMD Crest houses a 5000mAh battery that promises all-day usage on a single charge. For those who need a quick power top-up, it supports 33W wired fast charging, ensuring that the device can be charged up quickly when necessary. The device’s connectivity suite includes 5G support, allowing for high-speed data transfer where available, as well as 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0, and USB Type-C for fast data transfer and charging. The Crest also includes a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is becoming rare in many modern devices, making it a plus for users who prefer wired audio.
In terms of positioning, the HMD Crest includes GPS and GALILEO for accurate location tracking, although it lacks NFC support, which may be a dealbreaker for some users who rely on contactless payments.
### Durability and Repairability
A key feature of the HMD Crest is its focus on durability and repairability. It is dust and splash resistant, ensuring it can handle minor exposure to water and dust. The device is also repair-it-yourself capable, allowing users to easily replace key components like the display, back cover, battery, and charging port. This adds a layer of longevity to the device, allowing users to maintain and fix the phone without needing to go to a service center.

## Redmi 14C Overview
The Xiaomi Redmi 14C is a remarkable smartphone that offers exceptional value without compromising on performance. With its stylish design, powerful features, and affordable price, this device is perfect for those seeking a reliable and efficient companion.
### Design and Display
This phone, which is the Redmi 13C's replacement, has a very different appearance. Instead of a squircle camera island on the side, we have a huge circular one aligned at the center. In Nepal, the color options are Midnight Black, Sage Green, and Dreamy Purple.  
  
The Redmi 14C's 6.88-inch screen has expanded significantly in size. Even though it's enormous, the display is only average in quality. Only HD+ resolution and 8-bit color with 70% NTSC gamut coverage are available. This device has a maximum brightness of 600 nits. It does, however, have a touch sampling rate of 240 Hz and a smooth refresh rate of 120 Hz.
### Performance
The Redmi 14C was intended to come with the MediaTek Helio G91 Ultra, according to the leak. But instead, the Helio G81 Ultra phone has arrived. It is a new chipset that seems to be an improvement over the 2020 G80 processor. It might have used a more recent fabrication technique, even if the peak frequency and core architecture seem to have remained the same.
Meanwhile, there are three alternative configurations available for this phone. 4GB + 128GB, 6GB + 128GB, and 8GB + 256GB are those. Here, the storage is eMMC 5.1 and the RAM is LPDDR4X. Up to 8GB of additional memory can be added to this phone. Storage expansion is also an option, however it's unclear how much it can hold.
### Camera and the rest
It appears that the phone has four cameras, but this is untrue. Not even any lenses are housed in two of the back cutouts. One serves as an LED flash, and the other is utilized to brand the "50MP AI Camera." Yes, a 50MP main sensor is included with the Redmi 14C. Even the firm dismisses another lens by calling it a "auxiliary lens." As a result, this phone essentially has a single camera. A 13MP camera for selfies and face unlock is located on the front.
Regarding the battery, the Redmi 14C has a 5,160 mAh cell and is capable of 18W rapid charging via a USB Type-C connector. For further protection, a fingerprint sensor is built inside the power button.

The Infinix Hot 50 Pro stands out in Nepal’s mid-range smartphone market with its sleek, modern design and premium display features. Sharing its design DNA with the rest of the Hot 50 series, the phone features flat edges, a clean back panel, and unique squircle-shaped camera modules that give it a distinct look. The device also comes with IP54 rating, making it resistant to dust and splashes — a rare bonus at this price point. Infinix is offering three color variants, including a sleek Titanium Grey.

Whether you're scrolling social media or gaming, the 1,800 nits peak brightness, 1,500Hz touch sampling rate, and full DCI-P3 color gamut.
**Powerful Performance with Gaming in Mind**
Under the hood, the Infinix Hot 50 Pro in Nepal runs on the MediaTek Helio G100 chipset, built on a power-efficient 6nm process.

The device supports Dynamic RAM Expansion, effectively giving you more multitasking power. This setup ensures smooth performance for casual users and mobile gamers alike. Infinix has optimized the phone for games like FreeFire and Mobile Legends, offering up to 90FPS gameplay. Backing it all is a large 5,000mAh battery with 33W fast charging. Battery features like bypass charging, liquid detection, and overnight protection further enhance longevity — ideal for users in Nepal who need all-day battery on the go.
**Camera and AI Features Tailored for Daily Use**

On the front, the 8MP selfie camera uses the GC08A8 sensor and is backed by Infinix AI for improved skin tones and lighting.

# HMD Crest Max Overview: A Mid-Range Powerhouse for Nepalese Users
**Power Meets Efficiency:**
The HMD Crest Max emerges as a compelling mid-range smartphone in Nepal’s fast-growing Android market, offering solid specs at a competitive price. Engineered for both performance and sustainability, it sports a sleek 6.67-inch OLED display with Full HD+ resolution (1080 x 2400 pixels), offering vibrant visuals and sharp content—ideal for streaming, gaming, and social media. With Android 14 out of the box, the Crest Max provides a clean software experience and is powered by the Unisoc T760 chipset, built on a 6nm process. This octa-core processor, combined with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage, makes multitasking smooth, while a microSDXC slot offers storage expansion (shared SIM slot).
**Built for Nepal: Repairable Design, 5G Support, and Long-Lasting Battery Life:**
One of the standout features for the Nepalese market is its repair-it-yourself capability a rare offering in this segment. Users can replace the battery, back cover, display, and even the charging port on their own, making it a sustainable choice for those in remote areas or looking to save on repair costs. The 5000 mAh battery, which is also user-replaceable, ensures full-day usage with ease, while 33W fast charging adds convenience. The phone supports 5G connectivity in Nepal with bands 1, 3, 28, 40, and 78, making it future-ready for networks being rolled out across major cities. Add to that dual nano-SIM slots, side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and IP-rated splash and dust resistance, and you have a device ready for the diverse conditions of Nepal.
**Camera-Centric Experience with 50MP Selfie Shooter and Reliable Daily Performance:**
Camera-wise, the 64MP main shooter is capable enough for day-to-day photography, complemented by a 5MP ultrawide and a 2MP macro sensor. The real surprise is the 50MP front camera, which caters well to selfie lovers and content creators on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube—platforms growing rapidly in Nepal. Despite lacking NFC, the Crest Max covers all essentials with Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth 5.0, and USB Type-C support. The inclusion of a 3.5mm headphone jack is another win for users who still prefer wired audio. Plus, the “Deep Purple” colorway adds a touch of style to an otherwise functional design.
**Conclusion:**
The HMD Crest Max is a well-rounded mid-range 5G smartphone with practical features, sustainable design, and solid performance, perfectly aligned with the needs of modern smartphone users in Nepal.

The phone runs on a Unisoc T7250 chipset with 4G connectivity. This processor contains two Cortex-A75 cores at 1.8GHz and six Cortex-A55 cores at 1.6GHz, paired with a Mali-G57 GPU running at 850MHz. Performance-wise, it’s similar to the Helio G81 Ultra in the Redmi A3 Pro but weaker than the Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 found in the Redmi A4.
### Battery
The Redmi A5 4G is powered by a 5,200mAh battery with 18W charging support, though the package includes a 15W adapter.

## Redmi Note 14 5G Overview
### Design and Display
The core design of both phones remains the same, however, the Redmi has given the Note 14 5G enough tweaks to be visually distinguishable. The camera cutout has grown larger, while the back panel has gone back to being curved. Similarly, the camera island has gone a bit softer with the edge and the LED flash has shifted a coupled millimetres up. The phone offers an added level of durability with an IP64 rating, reinforced internal design, and Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection.
On the front, it has a 6.67-inch OLED screen with FHD+ resolution. It offers a refresh rate of up to 120Hz and a peak brightness of 2,100 nits. You also get a standard and instantaneous touch sampling rate of 240Hz and 2,160Hz respectively. The display is capable of HDR10+ and covers the DCI-P3 color gamut. Moreover, it has received TÜV and SGS certifications for eye care features like low blue light.
### Performance
The MediaTek Dimensity 7025 Ultra serves as the brain of the Redmi Note 14 5G. With 6nm fabrication and a higher 2.5GHz clock speed, this chipset offers a decent upgrade over the Dimensity 6080 on its predecessor. Furthermore, the chip is paired with up to 12 GB of RAM and 512GB of UFS 2.2 storage. However only the 8/128GB and 8/256GB are likely to launch in Nepal For battery, it has a sizable 5,110 mAh cell with 45W charging support.
### Camera and the rest
The primary shooter on the Redmi Note 14 5G is a 108MP OIS-enabled lens coupled with a Sony LYT-600 sensor. Additionally, there is an 8MP ultrawide unit and a 2MP macro sensor. The latter barely adds to the photography experience though. Meanwhile, a 20MP camera sits on the front for selfies and 2D face scanning.
Connectivity-wise, you get dual-SIM support with 5G cellular, dual-band WiFi 5, and Bluetooth v5.3 for wireless medium. On the other hand, a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack handle the wired connections. For additional security, there is an in-display fingerprint sensor. The company also mentions “Heart rate detection” as a feature on this phone, but refuses to elaborate any further.

## CMF Phone 1 Overview
### Design and Display
Let’s address the most important side of the CMF Phone 1, which is its design. What sets this guy apart from the usual boring midrange phone is its interchangeable back cover. You can just simply open the screws for that. On the bottom, there is a rotating dial that acts as an accessory holder. Nothing ships this phone in two shades: Black, and Light Green in Nepal.
Flipping to the front, the phone houses a 6.67-inch AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. It is HDR 10+ certified and boasts a 2000nits of peak brightness.
### Performance
Powering the things from the core is a new Dimensity 7300 SoC. This 4nm-based 5G chipset is however less powerful than the Dimensity 7200 chip. Yes, you heard that right because this new chip features less powerful Cortex-A78 and Cortex-A55 cores as compared to the 7200’s more powerful Cortex-A715 cores and Cortex-A510 cores. Handling the graphics here is a Mali-G615 MC2 GPU.
CMF has paired the processor with 8GB of RAM and 128/256GB of UFS 2.2 internal storage. Meanwhile, booting the Phone 1 is Nothing OS 2.6 built on top of Android 14.
### Camera
In terms of optics, the device flaunts a dual camera setup on its back. The primary sensor is a 50MP shooter accompanied by a 2MP depth sensor. Upfront, there is a 16MP snapper for selfies and video calls. As for the videos, the rear camera supports 4K res videos at 30fps. Moreover, you also get TrueLens Engine 2.) on this phone providing Ultra XDR, AI Vivid Modes, Motion Capture, and Night Mode.
### Battery and Charging
Fueling the phone is a 5000mAh battery with 33W charging support. It also supports 5W reverse wired charging. Connectivity features include 5G, WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, GPS, and a USB Type-C port.

## CMF Phone 2 Pro Overview
### Design and Display
What if your phone didn’t just look different but _felt_ different too? That’s the vibe CMF is going for with the CMF Phone 2 Pro, a smartphone that offers a pleasantly personalized alternative to the typical glass slabs. Much like its predecessor, this phone comes with a user-replaceable back cover which you can unscrew and swap out in minutes. It’s a modular touch you don’t often see, especially in this price range.
The design also packs subtle durability perks. It carries an IP54 rating and can survive water splashes and even shallow dips (up to 25cm for 20 minutes), according to the manufacturer. CMF is shipping the Phone 2 Pro in four colors in Nepal: White, Black, Orange, and Light Green.
Flip it over, and you’re greeted with a massive 6.77-inch AMOLED display. It’s bright peaking at a crazy 3000 nits and supports HDR10+ and Ultra HDR, making it great for watching vivid, contrast-heavy content. With 120Hz refresh rate and 1 billion colors, this panel isn’t just smooth; it’s gorgeous.
### Performance
At the core of the Phone 2 Pro is the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro chip, built on a power-efficient 4nm process. The CPU here includes four high-performance Cortex-A78 cores, and it’s paired with a Mali-G615 MC2 GPU for graphics.
This setup is backed by 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of internal storage, with the bonus of microSD card support. The phone boots on Android 15 right out of the box, topped with Nothing OS 3.2. CMF is promising 3 major Android updates, which is reassuring in a world where midrange phones often get left behind.
### Camera
This is where the Phone 2 Pro really turns up the heat. On the back, you get a triple camera system featuring a 50MP main sensor, a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom, and an 8MP ultrawide shooter. That’s a solid, versatile combo for a phone in this segment.
For video lovers, it supports 4K recording at 30fps, and there’s gyro-EIS for steadier shots. Up front, a 16MP selfie camera gets the job done for video calls and social media snaps with 1080p video support.
### Battery and Charging
Keeping the lights on is a 5000mAh battery, which should comfortably last a full day. It supports 33W wired charging and also comes with 5W reverse wired charging, letting you top up accessories like earbuds on the go.
Connectivity-wise, you get the usual suspects: 5G, WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, and NFC (depending on the region). And yes, there’s a USB Type-C port, but no headphone jack you probably saw that coming.

## Realme 14T 5G Overview
The Realme 14T 5G features a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and up to 2100 nits peak brightness. It is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset, paired with up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. The phone includes a dual rear camera setup with a 50MP main sensor and a 2MP secondary lens, along with a 16MP front camera. It runs on Android 15, has a 6000mAh battery with 45W fast charging support, and skips both the headphone jack and NFC.
### Performance 
Instead of going with a high-end chip, Realme chose the MediaTek Dimensity 6300, and honestly, that was a smart move for this phone’s purpose. Whether it’s social scrolling, YouTube, messaging, or light gaming, things move smoothly without overheating or draining the battery too fast. It runs Android 15 with Realme UI 6.0, and the software feels clean nothing bloated or sluggish. You get up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which is more than enough for most people.
### Battery 
There’s a 6000mAh battery inside, and that’s where the 14T quietly shines. You can go a full day and a half, maybe even two, on a single charge if you're not constantly gaming or streaming. It supports 45W wired charging, and gets to about 50% in half an hour quick enough for most daily routines. There’s no wireless charging, but it does support bypass charging, which is useful when you're plugged in for a longer gaming session.
### Display 
The 6.67-inch AMOLED display is actually one of the highlights here. It’s bright (up to 2100 nits), smooth thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate, and has slim bezels that make it feel more immersive than you’d expect at this price. Whether you're binge-watching or just checking the news, the screen stays sharp and easy on the eyes. Colors are vibrant, but not oversaturated it strikes a nice balance.
### Camera
On the back, the Realme 14T has a 50MP main camera, paired with a very basic 2MP sensor. It’s not trying to replace a DSLR, but it does its job well for everyday shots good light, decent detail, and not much fuss. Video maxes out at 1080p@60fps, and while there's no 4K, it has gyro-EIS, which helps with shaky hands. The 16MP selfie camera is clean and simple, perfect for video calls and social posts.
### Sound & Connectivity
There are stereo speakers that are loud enough for casual media and calls, and while there’s no headphone jack, wireless audio works well via Bluetooth 5.3. It also supports 24-bit/192kHz Hi-Res audio, which audiophiles might appreciate. Connectivity-wise, it checks most boxes with 5G, Wi-Fi ac, and solid GPS coverage. No NFC here, and no FM radio either, but it’s otherwise well-equipped for daily use.

# Honor 400 Lite: Overview
**Stylish Design and Bright AMOLED Display**
The Honor 400 Lite brings a modern design that feels both premium and practical. Its flat frame and slim body make it easy to hold, while the back design gives off an iPhone-like vibe thanks to its rectangular camera module. The phone weighs just 171 grams and measures only 7.29mm thick, making it super comfortable to use daily. It comes in two stylish color options in Nepal—Mars Green and Velvet Gray. Up front, you get a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a resolution of 2412 x 1080 pixels. What really stands out is the peak HDR brightness of 3,500 nits, which makes the screen easy to view even under bright sunlight.The phone has an IP65 rating, so it's splash-resistant—good for everyday use but not for full underwater dives. That said, Honor says you can take photos underwater, and it can reportedly survive drops from up to 6 feet. For security, there’s an in-display fingerprint scanner, and the display is certified by TÜV Rheinland and SGS, which means less eye strain from flickering during long use.
**Decent Performance and All-Day Battery**
Performance-wise, the Honor 400 Lite is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7025-Ultra processor. It features Cortex A78 cores at 2.5GHz, which should be more than enough for daily use, social media, and even some gaming. On the graphics side, it uses the IMG BXM-8-256 GPU, which handles casual games well. The phone comes with 8GB or 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, giving you enough space for apps, videos, and photos. It runs on MagicOS 9.0, based on Android 15, though software support duration hasn’t been confirmed yet. Powering everything is a 5230mAh battery, backed by 35W fast charging, which should easily last through a full day of use.
**Sharp Cameras and Smart AI Features**
On the camera front, the Honor 400 Lite features a 108MP main sensor with 3x lossless zoom and an f/1.75 aperture, promising sharp and clear photos in daylight. It also includes a 5MP ultrawide lens that can also act as a depth sensor. A cool extra is the AI camera button below the power key, which can instantly launch the camera, take photos or videos, zoom in, and even search for objects when held down. With its mix of smart features and clean design, the Honor 400 Lite offers great value for buyers in Nepal looking for a stylish and capable mid-range smartphone.

# Infinix GT 30 Pro Overview
**Performance**
The GT 30 Pro leans on MediaTek’s Dimensity 8350 Ultimate, a 4 nm chip that breezes through PUBG, Insta scrolling, and Lightroom tweaks without dropping frames. Paired with 8 GB RAM (expandable to 12 GB via memory fusion) and fast UFS 4.0 storage, apps pop open in a blink. XOS 15 on Android 15 feels lighter than past Infinix skins, and the dual-shoulder GT triggers give you console-style taps with almost zero input lag and handy for clutch matches on Nepali servers.
**Design and Display**
At first glance the 6.78-inch LTPS AMOLED steals the show: 144 Hz refresh keeps animations liquid-smooth, while 2000-nit peak brightness stays legible even under Pokhara’s midday sun. Gorilla Glass 7i fronts the panel, and a neat RGB strip on the back adds gamer flair without looking kitsch. You can pick from Blade White, Shadow Ash, or Dark Flare finishes; all three hide fingerprints better than you’d think. The squared-off frame sits comfortably in one hand, and IP64 sealing shrugs off dust on Himalayan trails.
**Camera**
A 108 MP main shooter snaps crisp daylight photos with plenty of detail for Instagram Reels, while the 8 MP ultrawide widens the scene for group shots at Pashupatinath or sunset landscapes in Sarangkot. Selfie duties fall to a 13 MP front cam that handles skin tones well and supports 4K video. Night mode is decent, pulling in enough light without turning everything into a watercolor painting.
**Battery, Charging & Extras**
The 5550 mAh cell (5200 mAh in some markets) easily powers a full day of heavy use think 7-plus hours of screen-on time. When you’re low, 45 W wired or 30 W wireless top-ups get you back to 50 % in roughly half an hour, and bypass charging keeps temps down during marathon gaming. Infinix even bundles a MagCharge Cooler that clips on magnetically and drops temps by about 30 %. Toss in stereo speakers, an in-display fingerprint reader, and 0 % EMI deals at hukut store, and you get a feature-packed mid-ranger.
**Who It’s For / Ideal Use**
If you’re looking for the “best gaming phone under 50,000 in Nepal” that can double as a daily driver, the Infinix GT 30 Pro nails the brief. It suits students who live on Mobile Legends, creators who need a bright panel for color-accurate edits, and road warriors who hate hunting for chargers. In short, anyone wanting flagship-style extras on a mid-tier budget should keep this handset on their radar.

## Realme 14 5G: Overview
The Realme 14 5G features a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and peak brightness of 2000 nits. It is powered by the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 processor paired with up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage. The phone includes a 50MP main camera with OIS and a 16MP front-facing camera, both capable of recording in 1080p or higher. It runs on Android 15 with Realme UI 6.0 and houses a 6000mAh battery that supports 45W wired charging.
### Performance 
Under the hood, the Realme 14 packs Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 chip, and for a midrange phone, it’s smooth like, genuinely smooth. App switching, gaming, even light video editing doesn’t feel sluggish. And the Adreno 810 GPU? It holds its own surprisingly well in graphics-heavy tasks. Android 15 with Realme UI 6.0 is clean, responsive, and doesn’t feel bloated.
Whether you pick the 8GB or 12GB RAM model, paired with up to 512GB of internal storage, there’s zero compromise in day-to-day use. No microSD card, but honestly, you’re unlikely to run out of room.
### Battery 
Here’s the part that stands out: 6000mAh battery. This thing is a tank. Two full days on moderate use isn’t a stretch. And when you do need to juice up, 45W fast charging brings it back to life quickly 50% in just 30 minutes. Plus, there’s bypass charging for when you're gaming and want to avoid battery heat. Smart stuff.
### Display 
The 6.67-inch AMOLED display is crisp, fluid, and bright enough to fight off direct sunlight, peaking at 2000 nits. Scrolling and gaming benefit from the 120Hz refresh rate, which makes the whole experience feel more premium than the price suggests.
### Camera
Realme didn’t overcomplicate things here. You get a single 50MP main camera with OIS and PDAF, and it shoots sharp photos that are surprisingly stable—even in low light. Video goes up to 4K@30fps, with electronic stabilization keeping things steady. The 16MP front cam handles selfies just fine, with some pleasant HDR tuning that doesn’t go overboard.
### Audio & Connectivity
Stereo speakers? Check. No headphone jack, sadly, but wireless audio works well with Bluetooth 5.2. The phone supports Wi-Fi 6, so no issues with fast networks. GPS performance is reliable thanks to multiple satellite systems onboard. NFC is missing, which might be a dealbreaker for contactless payment fans.
### Design & Build
At 196g, the Realme 14 feels substantial but not heavy. The 8mm slim profile makes it easy to hold, and while the design isn’t revolutionary, the Silver, Titanium, and Pink options give it some personality. Realme kept it clean no huge logos or odd camera bumps.

## Samsung Galaxy A54 Overview:
### Design
If you remember, Galaxy A53 shares the same design as the A52 from 2021. But Samsung has made some design changes with the A54, drawing cues from the flagship S23 series. As a result, the smartphone looks quite identical to the vanilla S23, both from the front and the back with a glass back.
It is available in three shades: Awesome Violet, Awesome Lime, and Awesome Graphite. The smartphone also bags an IP67 certification for protection against dust and water.
Moreover, the Galaxy A54 features a 6.4″ screen with a centered punch hole. It’s a Super AMOLED display with Full HD+ resolution, protected by Gorilla Glass 5. And you get 120Hz of refresh rate while the peak brightness is rated at 1000 nits.
### Camera
Moving on to the cameras, while the older A52 and A53 both had a 64MP primary lens, Samsung is changing things up for the Galaxy A54 which now sports a 50MP primary camera with OIS. It is followed by 12MP ultrawide and 5MP macro units. It has a 32MP selfie snapper on the front. Samsung has also provided Nightography for low-light imageries.
### Performance
Under the hood, the device packs the newly-announced Exynos 1380 5G processor. Based on the 5nm process, this SoC has four Cortex-A78 (@2.4 GHz) and four Cortex-A55 (@2.0 GHz) cores. Similarly, the Mali G68 MP5 GPU is there for the graphics.
Looking at the core architecture, the Exynos 1380 should deliver the same performance as the Snapdragon 778G chipset. As for the software, it boots on the latest One UI 5.1 based on Android 13. The company has pledged to provide 4 years of major OS updates with 5 years of security patch updates on the Galaxy A54.
### Rest of the specs
Furthermore, a 5000mAh battery powers the phone, whereas the charging speed is still capped at 25W. The connectivity options include 5G, WiFi 5, NFC, GPS, Bluetooth 5.3, and USB Type-C port. Likewise, you also get Dolby Atmos-tuned stereo speakers, Voice Focus, Privacy Dashboard, Samsung Knox, Samsung wallet, etc.

# Honor 400: Overview
**Sleek Design and Smooth Display**
The Honor 400 carries a clean and stylish design that closely matches its Pro version. It comes in three attractive color options in Nepal with Desert Gold, Tidal Blue, and Midnight Black. The camera module is the same as the Pro, but the phone has a flat middle frame instead of a curved one. For protection, it features an IP66 rating, so it’s resistant to dust and water splashes, great for everyday use in unpredictable weather. The front side is dominated by a 6.55-inch AMOLED curved screen, which offers a sharp resolution of 2736 x 1264 pixels. The display supports 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10, and 3840Hz PWM dimming, making it smooth for scrolling and safe for the eyes. There's also a punch-hole cutout instead of a pill-shaped notch, giving it a cleaner look.
**Good Performance with Long-Term Support**
At its core, the Honor 400 is powered by the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 processor. It’s a 4nm chip that performs well for regular tasks, social media use, and light gaming. Backed by 12GB LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB UFS 4.0 storage, this phone ensures quick app launches and plenty of room for photos, videos, and apps. It runs on Android 15, layered with MagicOS 9.0, offering a clean user experience with smart AI features like language translation and writing suggestions. What’s more, Honor guarantees 6 years of software and security updates, which is a big plus for buyers in Nepal who want reliable long-term usage without needing to upgrade often.
**Camera and Battery to Match Your Lifestyle**
The camera setup is one of the main highlights of the Honor 400. You get a 200MP main camera with OIS, perfect for detailed shots, and a 12MP ultrawide sensor that can also take close-up macro photos. While it doesn’t include a telephoto lens, the front has a solid 50MP selfie camera for clear video calls and selfies. Fueling all this is a 6000mAh silicon-carbon battery, which easily lasts more than a day. Charging is fast too, with support for 80W wired and wireless SuperCharge. Other features include WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.4, eSIM, USB-C, and an in-display fingerprint scanner, making the Honor 400 a balanced mid-range option for users in Nepal.

# Honor 400 Pro: Overview
**Premium Look, Built to Last**
The Honor 400 Pro doesn’t just perform well—it looks the part too. Its slim profile, just 8.1mm thick, paired with a weight of 205 grams, gives it a nice balance between solid and sleek. In Nepal, it's available in two classy finishes: Midnight Black and Lunar Grey. The phone comes with IP68 and IP69 ratings, meaning it's protected against both dust and strong water pressure. Whether you’re caught in the rain or out on a hike, it can handle the elements. Up front, it sports a 6.7-inch AMOLED display that’s sharp, colorful, and fluid thanks to its 1224 x 2700 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. With a peak brightness of 5000 nits, visibility outdoors is never an issue.
**Fast, Fluid, and Future-Ready**
Performance is a real highlight on the Honor 400 Pro. It runs on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, built with 4nm technology—one of the most powerful mobile processors right now. Whether you're switching between apps, editing videos, or playing high-end games, this phone doesn’t flinch. You also get 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of internal storage, giving you plenty of space and speed. Out of the box, it runs on MagicOS 9, which is layered over Android 15. For users in Nepal, one of the biggest perks is Honor’s 6-year update guarantee, which is rare and adds great long-term value.
**Cameras Packed with Power and AI**
Photography is another area where the Honor 400 Pro shines. The rear setup includes a 200MP main sensor with OIS for clearer shots, a 50MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide lens for capturing more in every frame. On the front, there’s a 50MP selfie camera alongside a 2MP depth sensor, both housed in a pill-shaped notch. But this phone isn’t just about megapixels. It also brings helpful AI tools like deepfake detection, live call translation, and writing assistance. Backed by a 6000mAh battery that supports 100W fast charging and 50W wireless charging, the phone keeps up with your day. It also includes Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, and an in-display fingerprint scanner. For anyone in Nepal looking for a high-end Android experience that ticks every box, the Honor 400 Pro is an easy recommendation.

## Apple iPhone 14: A Solid Upgrade
The iPhone 14 is a reliable mid-range smartphone that retains the iconic design of its predecessor while introducing notable improvements in performance, camera capabilities, and safety features.
#### Design and Display
The iPhone 14 features the same design as its predecessor, with a large notch on the front and diagonally aligned camera lenses on the back. The entire body is made of aerospace-grade aluminum, offering durability and a premium feel. It is dust and water-resistant to IP68 standards, ensuring protection against everyday hazards. The front is protected by a Ceramic Shield, providing enhanced scratch resistance. The 6.1-inch SuperRetina XDR OLED display supports Dolby Vision HDR, P3, and True Tone, with a peak HDR brightness of 1200 nits and a refresh rate of 60Hz. While it lacks ProMotion, the display still offers vibrant visuals and excellent clarity.
#### Performance
Under the hood, the iPhone 14 is powered by the A15 Bionic chip, a 5-core GPU version of the SoC found in last year’s iPhone 13 Pro models. This chip provides a performance boost of 18% compared to its predecessor. The iPhone 14 is available in three storage options: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, catering to various user needs.
#### Cameras
The iPhone 14 features a dual-camera setup on the back, including a 12MP wide-angle primary sensor with a larger f/1.5 aperture and sensor-shift OIS, paired with a 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens. These cameras, combined with the new Photonic Engine, deliver significant improvements in low-light performance. The Photonic Engine enhances the main sensor’s mid-to-low-light performance by 2.5x and the ultrawide and selfie camera’s performance by 2x. For the first time, the front camera also features autofocus, making selfies and video chats sharper and clearer.
#### Battery
The iPhone 14 offers impressive battery life, providing up to 80 hours of audio playback and up to 20 hours of video playback. It charges with a 20W adapter, reaching 50% capacity in about 30 minutes. The phone also supports 15W MagSafe Wireless and 7.5W Qi wireless charging, offering flexible charging options.
#### Extras
The iPhone 14 series introduces several safety features. The “Crash Detection” feature uses the phone’s high-dynamic range gyroscope and dual-core accelerometer to automatically connect to emergency services in the event of an accident. Additionally, the Emergency SOS via Satellite feature allows users to send messages even without cellular connection by pointing the phone at a satellite. Apple’s specialized software guides users to the optimal satellite position, ensuring reliable communication in emergencies.
Overall, the iPhone 14 is a well-rounded device that balances familiar design with enhanced performance, camera capabilities, and innovative safety features, making it a solid choice for Apple enthusiasts.

### OnePlus 13 Overview: A Leap in Design, Performance, and Features
The OnePlus 13 introduces a refined design, moving away from the bold camera module of its predecessor to a simpler, less protruding island. This minimalist approach gives the device a clean, modern look. A significant upgrade is the inclusion of IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance, a leap from the OnePlus 12's IP65 rating. The screen features a flatter panel with slightly curved edges, providing a more stable viewing experience. The display is BOE's X2 OLED with 8T LTPO technology, offering QHD resolution and a peak brightness of up to 4500 nits. The 6.82-inch display is slightly shorter but wider, and it now includes a more secure ultrasonic fingerprint sensor under the screen, enhancing security and convenience.
### Powerful Performance and Gaming Enhancements
Under the hood, the OnePlus 13 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, fabricated on TSMC’s 3nm process. This processor delivers a 45% boost in CPU performance and a 44% improvement in efficiency, thanks to new Oryon prime and performance cores. The Adreno 830 GPU provides up to 40% better performance, making the OnePlus 13 a formidable gaming device. To enhance the gaming experience, the phone includes a new, larger gaming vibration motor, which is touted as the biggest in any Android phone. Memory configurations start at 12GB of LPDDR5x RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage, with options up to 24GB RAM and 1TB storage. The OnePlus 13 runs on ColorOS 15 in China, with the global variant expected to feature OxygenOS on Android 15.
### Advanced Camera System and Battery Life
The OnePlus 13 maintains a harmonious rear camera setup with a primary, ultrawide, and telephoto configuration. All three sensors are optimized by Hasselblad, ensuring high-quality imaging. The main camera is Sony’s LYT 808 with OIS, the 3x periscope is the LYT 600 (also with OIS), and the ultrawide is Samsung’s JN5 sensor. The front-facing 32MP camera carries over from the OnePlus 12, featuring a 1/2.74” sensor with an f/2.4 aperture. The device also introduces a Silicon Carbide battery, allowing for a larger 6000mAh cell in a similar footprint. This results in an 11% increase in battery capacity compared to the OnePlus 12. Despite the larger battery, charging speeds remain impressive, with 100W wired, 50W wireless, and 10W reverse wireless charging. The phone can reach 50% in just 13 minutes and 100% in 36 minutes.

## Vivo X200 Pro Overview
### Design and Display
Speaking of the design, the Vivo X200 Pro boasts a curved frame design with a glossy back and an Oreo-styled circular camera module on the rear. It is available in four color options: Cosmos Black, and Titanium Grey. In terms of ingress protection, it secures both IP68 + IP69 ratings against dust and water damage.
Upfront, the curved screen has bid a farewell but not completely, if you take a closer look. The Vivo X200 Pro now sports a flat display with lightly curved edges on all four corners, like on the Xiaomi 14 Pro. It is a 6.78-inch AMOLED panel with 2K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.
### Zeiss coated cameras
The star of the show to no one’s surprise, the mighty Zeiss cameras here backed up by Vivo’s custom V3+ imaging chip on the Vivo X200 Pro. And the most interesting among the pack is the Zeiss 200MP APO Super Telephoto lens with a 1/1.4-inch sensor size and Zeiss’s superior chromatic control, ensuring superb clarity and accurate colors. It now offers up to 135mm portraits which is like a 5.5X zoom. At the same time, the optical zoom quality is 3.7X (85mm).
Likewise, the main camera is a 1/1.28-inch 50MP Sony LYT-818 sensor with Vivo’s self-developed blueprint sensor technology, improving ghosting and stray light effects to form a realistic output. Lastly, there is a 50MP ultrawide unit with Autofocus and 119˚FoV and a 32MP selfie snapper. Moreover, the Vivo X200 Pro can capture up to 8K res videos at 30fps from the rear camera and up to 4K 60fps videos from the front camera.
### 3nm Processor
Powering the core is a Mediatek Dimesnity 9400 processor, a 3nm fabbed flagship chip. It features a core Cortex-X925 at 3.63GHz, three Cortex-X4 cores at 3.3 GHz, and four Cortex-A720 cores at 2.4GHz. Meanwhile, the Immortalis-G925 GPU handles the graphics. Vivo has paired the chip with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage. Likewise, the Vivo X200 Pro boots on OriginOS 5.0 built on top of Android 15.
### Battery and Others
Moving on, the Vivo X200 Pro gets its juice from a sizeable 6000mAh high-density Silicon Carbon battery with 90W wired fast charging support, 30W wireless, and reverse wired charging support. Connectivity features include 5G, WiFi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, GPS, NFC, Infrared, and a USB Type-C 3.2 port.

## Tecno Spark 30C Overview
### Design and Display
The Tecno Spark 30C looks pretty standard for a smartphone. There isn’t much going on over here, it has a large centre-aligned camera island. It is IP54-rated and is available in three outlooks: Orbit Black, Orbit White, and Magic Skin 3.0. The former has a monotone finish, while the middle option has a bit of gradient to it. The latter choice stands out the most, as it has vegan leather for its back panel.
The display is also a standard game. It has a 6.67-inch screen, however, the panel type has not been specified by the company. It is likely an LCD, as it is the most sensible option. Regardless, the Tecno Spark 30C offers you an HD+ resolution and a smooth refresh rate of 120Hz. It also supports touch inputs even when the screen has water or oil on it.
### Performance
Under the helm is the MediaTek Helio G81 chipset, which launched near the end of August. Even though it has been a while since it was launched, MediaTek still has not listed it on its website. This is why, we are taking Nanoreview as a reference for the information on the SoC. As per them, the silicon comes with eight cores, 12nm fabrication, and a peal clock speed of 2.0GHz. While the Redmi 14C did feature the Helio G81 Ultra, the Tecno Spark 30C is likely the first phone to have the standard version.
This smartphone comes in three memory choices: 4GB, 6GB, and 8GB. Meanwhile, you can choose between 128GB and 256GB for the internal storage. Altogether, the Tecno Spark 30C is available in four configurations: 4GB + 128GB, 4GB + 256GB, 6GB + 128GB, and 8GB + 256GB. Users can virtually double the memory on this thing, however, it appears there is no option for storage expansion. Talking of the software, this phone boots on Android 14.
### Camera and the rest
In terms of the camera, you get a primary 50MP unit at the back. It is assisted by a dummy lens, making it look like a dual-camera setup. However, that is definitely not the case. Likewise, it has a decent 8MP shooter on the front. In the tank, Tecno Spark 30C packs a 5,000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. It has a stereo speaker setup with DTS tuning and apparently can deliver up to 300% louder volume. Lastly, the phone is equipped with an IR blaster too.

## OPPO A60 Overview
### Design and Display
The OPPO A60 comes in a flat design and a pill-shaped camera island on the back. It is available in two different finishes — the first one is a monotone Midnight Purple, while the other is ripple-patterned Ripple Blue. It also comes with IP54 water and dust resistance along with MIL-STD-810H certification.
On the front, you get a 6.67-inch A-Si LCD panel with KK6 cover glass. The screen stretches HD+ in resolution and offers a refresh rate of 90Hz. Additionally, it comes with a maximum touch sampling rate of 240Hz, a peak brightness of 950nits, and an 83% [NTSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC) colour gamut.
### Performance
For the primary performance, the OPPO A60 relies on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 chipset. It is a 4G-only chip that comes with eight cores, 6nm fabrication, and a peak clock speed of 2.4GHz. Moreover, the chip is about three years old at this point and prioritizes battery life more than anything else.
Other than that, you get an 8GB LPDDR4x RAM coupled with two options of UFS 2.2 storage. The storage option includes 128GB or 256GB internal and support for expansion via a MicroSD card. Similarly, it allows you to double the RAM capacity virtually if you require more memory on your phone. On the software front, the OPPO A60 boots on ColorOS 14.0.1 based on Android 14.
### Camera and the rest
Moving on to the imaging capabilities of this phone, it wields a dual camera setup on the back. The primary of which is a 50MP shooter while the secondary camera is a measly 2MP unit. On the other hand, you get an 8MP selfie camera on the OPPO A60.
In the tank, the phone comes with a 5,000 mAh cell with 45W SUPERVOOC charging support. For security, you get a side-mounted fingerprint reader as well as a facial recognition feature. Meanwhile, the OPPO A60 offers wireless connectivity through dual SIM, 4G cellular, dual-band WiFi, Bluetooth v5.0, and NFC (region-specific) support. Likewise, the wired connections on this phone are handled by a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack.

## OPPO Reno 11 F 5G Overview
### Design and Display
The phone comes in a flat boxy design with an IP65 rating and a large rectangular camera island. Additionally, there are two circular cutouts for the cameras that house three lenses. All this makes the rear panel of the phone very eye-catching. The OPPO Reno 11 F 5G is available in three colours: Palm Green, Ocean Blue, and Coral Purple. The first, and the last option come in a glittery finish while the middle one flaunts water-like patterns on the back.
On the front, you are greeted with a 2.5D curved screen that measures 6.7 inches diagonally. The panel here is an OLED that is twice-reinforced by Panda glass. Meanwhile, the screen spans FHD+ in resolution with 1,080 horizontal and 2,412 vertical pixels. It also offers a refresh rate of 120Hz, maximum touch sampling rate of 240Hz, and peak brightness of 1,100 nits. Other than that, it supports a 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut.
### Performance
For its primary performance, the OPPO Reno 11 F 5G relies on the MediaTek Dimensity 7050 chipset. This is a 2023 processor that comes with eight cores, 6 nanometre fabrication, and a peak clock speed of 2,600 MHz. Meanwhile, the graphics on this phone are handled by ARM Mali-G68 MC4.

However, it does offer RAM extension and storage expansion of 8GB, and 2TB via a MicroSD card respectively. In the meantime, this phone boots on the ColorOS 14.0 based on Android 14.
### Camera and the rest

Furthermore, an 8MP ultrawide camera with 112° FOV as well as a 2MP macro lens further assist the primary shooter. On the other hand, you have a 32MP snapper sitting underneath a centre-aligned hole-punch camera.

In addition to that, this also comes with dual-band WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and NFC capabilities. Meanwhile, for the wired connection, you have to make do with a single USB Type-C port.

## Redmi A5 4G 
### Display and Design
The device features a 6.88-inch 120Hz LCD display, likely with 720p+ resolution. Additionally, it comes in four color options and includes a side-mounted fingerprint sensor for quick access.
### Camera Setup
The Redmi A5 4G sports an 8MP front camera, upgraded from the 5MP in previous models. However, the rear camera has been downgraded to 32MP from the 50MP sensors found in earlier versions.
### Performance
The phone runs on a Unisoc T7250 chipset with 4G connectivity. This processor contains two Cortex-A75 cores at 1.8GHz and six Cortex-A55 cores at 1.6GHz, paired with a Mali-G57 GPU running at 850MHz. Performance-wise, it’s similar to the Helio G81 Ultra in the Redmi A3 Pro but weaker than the Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 found in the Redmi A4.
### Battery
The Redmi A5 4G is powered by a 5,200mAh battery with 18W charging support, though the package includes a 15W adapter.

## Redmi A3 Overview
The Redmi A3 is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers exceptional value without compromising on performance. With its stylish design, powerful features, and affordable price, this device is perfect for those seeking a reliable and efficient companion.
### Design and Display
To begin with, the Redmi A3's construction includes a glass front body, a glass back, and a plastic frame. A dual camera arrangement is housed in a striking circular camera module on the back of this smartphone. A 6.71-inch LCD screen with HD+ resolution and a refresh rate of 90 Hz is included up front. Even though it's a low-cost phone, the screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 3.
### Performance
The MediaTek Helio G36 chipset powers the smartphone's internal components. Four Cortex-A53 cores operating at 2.2GHz and four clocking at 1.6GHz are present in this 12nm fabbed octa-core processor. The PowerVR GE8320 GPU is in charge of the graphics tasks. Similarly, Redmi has combined this CPU with 128GB of eMMC 5.1 internal storage and up to 6GB of RAM.
In terms of software, the vanilla Android 14 is different from the MIUI that is typically seen on other Redmi phones. Because it's a low-cost phone and because the Redmi A1 and A2 have the same close-to-stock Android OS, it makes sense.
### Camera
In terms of optics, the gadget has two cameras. An 8MP camera and a pointless 0.08MP auxiliary lens are its main features. The U-shaped notch has a 5MP camera for video calls and selfies. Both cameras are capable of producing 1080p films at 30 frames per second.
### Battery and Others
The Redmi A3 is powered by a 5000mAh battery that supports 10W wired charging. WiFi, 4G, Bluetooth 5.3, a 3.5mm headphone socket, and a USB Type-C 2.0 port (for the first time on a Redmi A-Series smartphone) are among the connectivity choices available here. Additionally, a fingerprint scanner is positioned on the side for biometric security.

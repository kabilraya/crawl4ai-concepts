# Lenovo ThinkBook 13s Business Notebook with 13.3" WQXGA (2560x1600) Display, 11th Gen i7-1165G7 Processor, 8GB DDR4, 512GB SSD, Laptop

NPR 149,990.00NPR 155,990.00

### Next-gen dependability

No matter how complicated the task, work is done quicker than ever with the Lenovo ThinkBook 13s Gen 2 (Intel) laptop. It’s equipped with 11th Gen Intel® Core™ processors that keep the most demanding software running smoothly. And with bountiful memory and storage, long load times for complex files will be a thing of the past.

### Gorgeous view

The Lenovo ThinkBook 13s Gen 2 Intel-powered laptop brings visuals to life with up to WQXGA resolution and 4 million pixels. Dolby Vision™ and 100% sRGB color gamut produce striking image reproduction, while ultra-thin bezels provide an increased screen-to-body ratio from 78% to 90%. You can also navigate the screen like a smartphone with optional touchscreen. Eye Care Mode cuts down levels of blue light to alleviate eye-fatigue on those long workdays.

### Work smarter, not harder

The ThinkBook 13s Gen 2 PC is designed to meet the challenges of a changing workplace. You can control the receiving pattern of your microphone from unidirectional with noise-cancelling to 360-degree omnidirectional, so that you can switch from personal to group calls with clarity. And an AI based noise cancellation algorithm blocks out environmental noise in a work from home setting.

### Looks like a pro

Sleeker and lighter than the previous generation, the Lenovo ThinkBook 13s Gen 2 laptop powered by Intel, boasts an amazingly thin 14.9mm / .58” profile and weighs in at only 1.26kg / 2.78lbs. It’s ideal for on-the-go professionals and sure to turn heads with its dual-tone Mineral Gray top cover.

### The world, at the speed of light

The Lenovo ThinkBook 13s Gen 2 laptop, equipped with WiFi 6, helps you access the internet, upload, and download large files faster than ever. Lower latency and increased network bandwidth mean your teleconference calls will always go according to plan, while increased stability in crowded networks lets you work virtually anywhere. And with a full-functioning Thunderbolt™ 4 port, you get speedy 40Gbs data transfer rates for the latest peripherals.

### Amazon Alexa for your PC

With Alexa on your PC you can simplify your life and use your voice to get more done. Stay organized with shopping lists, to-do lists and reminders. Watch the news, listen to music, control your smart home from the comfort of your couch, video call with friends and family, and more. With Alexa Show Mode, you can use your PC as a full-screen interactive experience that features rich visuals and lets you talk to Alexa from across the room.

### Options galore

The IdeaPad 5 comes with a host of options including a USB-C port with power delivery that replaces the typical power supply jack or can be used to plug into an extra display. Rapid Charging gets your battery back up to the green in minutes. With an SSD drive and Windows 10, this PC is more than just an everyday laptop.

### No peeking

Sticky notes are dead. The IdeaPad 5's webcam privacy shutter provides a physical barrier between your world and creepy hackers. With a fingerprint reader on the power button, you can set your IdeaPad to not wake up unless it detects your biometric signature.

### Edgy visuals

We designed the displays on the IdeaPad 5 laptop to pack as much screen space into the surface area as possible, pushing visuals to the edge and giving you a viewing experience that feels bigger. We call this active area ratio, or the amount of screen compared to the size of the surrounding borders, and the IdeaPad 5 has an incredible 90% active area ratio.

### More for less

While it may be priced as an everyday-use laptop, the IdeaPad 3 (15, AMD) is as something much more. Up to an AMD Ryzen™ 7 4700U Mobile Processor—bolstered by powerful memory, storage and graphics options—means this device delivers beyond expectations. What’s more, whether you’re working on the family budget or preparing a spreadsheet, the handy numeric keypad will speed up your productivity.

### Great for entertainment

Narrow bezels on two sides let you get the most out of the IdeaPad 3 (15, AMD) laptop’s up to FHD display—and present a clean, contemporary look. Dual speakers enhanced with Dolby Audio™ enhances sound so you’ll love what you hear as well as what you see.

### Privacy at your fingertips

Privacy at your fingertips When it comes to privacy, sometimes the straightforward approach works best. That’s why we designed the IdeaPad 3 (15, AMD) laptop with a physical webcam shutter. When you’re done with your video chat, just close the shutter—and render your webcam hacker-proof.

### Quick & quiet with Q-control

Fast or chill: It’s your choice. Swap effortlessly between Max Mode, where your CPU takes charge and provides the quickest performance, and Stealth Mode for the quietest user-experience and longer battery life.

### Focus On The Game Not The Bezel

Focus on the game, not the bezels The Y730 Laptop’s 15.6-inch display provides a near-edgeless visual experience, thanks to bezels that are considerably thinner than previous generations. You can keep your eyes where the action is—the FHD graphics rendering in more than 2 million pixels at refresh rates 60 Hz, with brightness levels at 300 nits. And you’ll get an amazingly immersive experience from the tear-free video of optional NVIDIA® G-SYNC™ technology.

### Full-throttle power beneath the hood

The Y730 has a lot of muscle underneath its thin exterior. Pooling thousands of hours of experience and expertise in battery, I/O placement, thermals, motherboard design, and more, we’ve packed it with high-performance gaming hardware—including up to 16 GB overclocked Corsair® Memory and PCIe NVMe SSD storage.

### All of the power, none of the heat

Despite its souped-up performance, the Y730 will stay cool and quiet, so you can enjoy your games. It’s been remastered with a dual-channel thermal system, with the following benefits: individual CPU and GPU cooling, for cooler system temperatures; four thermal vents, for improved airflow; and 66 individual fan blades per channel, to reduce system noise.

### Full connectivity

The Y730 features a convenient array of ports and connectors; plug in an external device or accessory, or simply charge or secure your laptop with the following, as shown above:

1. Mini DP 1.4 port
2. HDMI 2.0 port
3. 2 x USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports\*
4. RJ-45 port
5. AC adaptor port
6. Kensington Lock slot

### Responsive performance and ample storage

Performance perfected: High-powered AMD Ryzen processors deliver speed and performance in a compact package.  
More memory: With increased performance, boosted bandwidth and epic energy efficiency with 8GB DDR4 memory, you’ll be running all your apps and multitasking like a pro in no time.  
Seismic storage: Your laptop offers multiple storage options for responsive performance and plenty of backup of 1TB HDD

### Family-friendly features

Universal connectivity: Charges your device, connects to Ethernet and USB and also supports both audio and video output for quick and easy connecting. Available on systems with discrete graphics only.  
Convenient optical drive: Watch movies, play games, listen to your favorite music with the DVD drive or backup data to your own discs.

### Designed for the real world — because that's where life happens.

Turn up the heat: From locker rooms to locked cars, we test Inspiron laptops for survival in harsh short-term heat conditions of up to 6°C/149F.  
Everything hinges on it: We test Inspiron laptop hinges to ensure they still feel tight, even after opening and closing the lid 20,000 times.  
Keys to success: We test commonly used keys for 10 million keystrokes and touch pad buttons 1 million times with no failure. So go ahead, finish your novel.  
Buttoned up: No matter what you set your power and multimedia buttons to do, we've tested them all to survive up to 40,000 pushes with no problems.  
Always a good fit: You'll probably never need to remove and reinstall your Inspiron's battery 30 times, but you can rest easy knowing that we've tested even that.

### DESIGNED FOR VR.

Dive into mind-bending virtual reality experiences with a VR-ready system that passes the Oculus Ready and Vive Optimized certifications. Powered by NVIDIA® VRWorks technology, a new level of presence is achieved by bringing physically realistic visuals, sound, touch interactions, and simulated environments to virtual reality. And with NVIDIA® GeForce® 10-series graphics, the Alienware 17 goes beyond what’s expected.

### HIGHER PERFORMANCE INSIDE OUT

Built with premium materials and up to 7th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 and i7k-Series processors, the Alienware 17 is the ultimate evolution in high-performance gaming technology. Utilizing magnesium alloy for rigidity, copper for better performance, anodized aluminum for extra protection and steel for tactile comfort, it features a high-quality design for high-performance gaming. And with support for up to NVIDIA® GeForce GTX 1080Ti or AMD Radeon RX 470 graphics, overclocked CPUs at 4.4GHz, and high-speed DDR4 system memory capable of up to 2667 MHz, you can experience gaming on a whole new level.

### A REVOLUTIONARY WAY TO USE YOUR PC

Tobii Aware software enables new gameplay functions for a completely unique user experience. Let your eyes be the controller and lose yourself in the game.

### NOTHING BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR GAMING

Witness the difference an expansive 17-inch LCD screen can make with supported FHD, QHD 120Hz and UHD resolution options – all with anti-glare finish. The 17" QHD 120Hz display is designed to deliver the smoothest gaming experience with a 4-millisecond response time​, wide viewing angles and 400 nits of brightness. The UHD panel offers a 100% color gamut for an incredible, saturated range of reds, greens and blues (compared to the 72% offered by QHD and FHD). NVIDIA® G-Sync technology, available on select models, delivers the smoothest, fastest experience ever thanks to synchronized display refresh rates to the GPU in your GeForce® GTX-powered PC, eliminating screen tearing and minimizing display stutter and input lag.

### A KEYBOARD LIKE NO OTHER

With an upgraded Alienware TactX keyboard, n-key rollover is now supported, enabling over 108-key commands for maximum actions per minute. It’s the only keyboard on a laptop with 2.2mm of key travel allowing for rapid response for any keystroke. Reinforced with a steel back plate for rigidity and uniform feedback with a guarantee to stay functional for up to 10 million keystrokes. Create a more personalized look for your machine with new and improved AlienFX. Designed with optimized RGB-LED enabled AlienFX lighting and now supported on over 130 games, with the option to create and download unique themes.

### DESIGNED TO KEEP COOL.

Higher maximum thermal design power (TDP) support means that your system can handle a higher total wattage for internal components, enabling a higher level of performance. With the entire ventilation system upgraded, your system can stay cool even under extreme graphics pressure.

### HEAR EVERY BATTLE CRY..

Due to the upgraded design, a larger and more effective speaker box has been installed, improving audio output for a clearer and more dramatic gaming experience.

### CLEAR THE DESKTOP & THE BOARD.

Avoid excess cables and embrace the “desktop mode” design, where most of your critical connections and ports are in the back and out of the way.

### EXPERIENCE THE FULL SPECTRUM

AlienFX uses 20 different colors to create over 80 quadrillion unique themes to give your machine a more personalized look. Supported on over 130 titles, lighting zones can be customized to react to things like in game actions, powering on and off, and notifications by pulsing, morphing or simply holding a solid color. Once you’ve finished your theme, you can save and upload it to the Alienware Arena community site where you can share your custom creation with others and download any you find. And for times when you want a little less visual stimulation, AlienFX allows you to “go dark” by disabling all lighting effects until you’re ready to turn them back on.

# ASUS ZenBook 15 8th gen i7 16GB 512 GB SSD, GTX 1050 Max-Q 2GB, 15.6” FHD, Windows 10 Home

### Asus ZenBook

Creativity. Style. Innovation. These are the qualities that define the elegant new ZenBook 15. Everything in this take-anywhere masterpiece — it’s the world’s smallest 15-inch laptops\* — is designed to give you the freedom to discover your creative power, including its breathtaking frameless NanoEdge display. You’ll appreciate not only the tremendous power within and the thoughtful attention to detail — such as the exclusive ErgoLift hinge and Numeric keypad — but also the timeless beauty of the design, with its sensational Royal Blue finish enhanced by the new Rose Gold trim panel. ZenBook 15 is waiting: are you ready to unleash your creative power?

### Unbounded beauty

Designed to give you the most screen area in the least physical space, the new frameless four-sided NanoEdge design of ZenBook 15 is simply breathtaking: it makes any visuals more immersive, with less distraction for your eyes. The ultraslim bezels1 are just 3mm thin at the sides, 4.5mm at the bottom and a mere 6.4mm at the top to accommodate the camera. The effect is truly stunning — it’s like an infinity pool for your eyes! And with this ultra-compact display, ZenBook 15 is one of the smallest 15-inch laptops around — as small as many 14-inch models.

### Spectacular visuals

Creativity demands a great screen, so ZenBook 15 has a high-resolution FHD display that's beautifully crisp and clear, with wide viewing angles and vivid, accurate colors that give you an ultra-realistic viewing experience for movies, photos and games. It also features exclusive ASUS technologies — including ASUS Splendid and ASUS Tru2Life Video — that fine-tune display parameters to ensure optimum eye comfort and color performance, for any kind of content.

### Ultraportable, redefined

ZenBook 15 heralds a new era of ultraportable design, with an ultracompact, ultralight chassis that makes it our smallest and lightest 15-inch laptop ever — in fact, at around the size of a 14-in laptop and just 3.5 lb, it’s one of the smallest and lightest 15-inch laptops — period! None of the traditional ZenBook style has been lost, though: there’s the iconic Zen-inspired spun-metal finish on the lid and a prestigious Royal Blue finish, newly enhanced with a contrasting Rose Gold trim panel above the keyboard for an extra touch of luxury.

### All-day battery for non-stop lifestyles

ZenBook 15 is powered by a high-capacity battery that won’t let you down, however long and demanding your working day is. Extended journeys or day-long meetings are no problem for ZenBook 15, even when power outlets are in short supply!

# Asus ROG ZEPHYRUS G14 GAMING AMD Ryzen R9 5900HS 1TB SSD, 16GB RAM, 14″ FHD 144Hz, RTX 3060 6GB Windows 10

NPR 217,999.00NPR 227,499.00

### Build Up

With clean aesthetics distilled into four unique flavors, the Zephyrus G14 is a stunner. Choose Moonlight White or Eclipse Gray, which both light up the 6,536 precision-milled perforations in the lid with a programmable AniMe Matrix™ mini-LED display. Or go with Holographic White or Holographic Gray for a subtler prismatic effect. A magnesium-aluminum alloy with honeycomb reinforcements keeps the chassis both strong and light.

### Precision Machining

The striking dot matrix design on the lid is made with a precision CNC milling process that creates 6,536 perfectly spaced perforations in an incredibly small surface area. The unique pattern is stylish yet subtle, with the diameter of the openings carefully chosen to emit just the right amount of light from the 1,215 mini-LEDs that lie below on the optional AniMe Matrix™ display.

### Light It Up

The groundbreaking AniMe Matrix™ display shows off your creativity through 1,215 programmable mini-LEDs that illuminate the lid. Display custom designs, unique animations, and live audio visualizations for extra flair. Or stay in the loop with status notifications about battery life, calendar, alarm and more. An all-new virtual pet from the ROG universe can hang out on the AniMe Matrix™, too. This interactive assistant reacts to system usage and battery level—and also stars in its own desktop app!

### Display

Choose the display that fits your needs. For the best of both worlds, the 120Hz QHD panel blends high refresh rates with high resolution and a pro-grade DCI-P3 color gamut. For lightning-fast gaming, the 144Hz Full HD panel mixes even higher refresh with vibrant sRGB color. Both are Pantone® Validated for color accuracy.

# ASUS ROG Strix SCAR 8th gen i7-8750H, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 15.6″ FULL HD 144hz, GTX 1070 8GB, Windows 10

# Esports-ready Display

### Battle Dressed

The Strix SCAR II features two contrasting brushed finishes that meet to create a dynamic diagonal slash across its lid. The anodized Gunmetal Gray finish and deep-black heatsink mimic the dark feel of military hardware — a true reflection of a soldier’s inner calm, focus, and precision.
**Stay Cooled During Competition**
The ROG HyperCool Pro thermal system has a host of features to help the Strix SCAR II get the most out of its high-performance GPU and CPU.

### Gaming Optimized Keyboard Layout

The desktop-inspired layout features a large space bar that’s easier to hit and 4 additional hotkeys for system controls. ROG Overstroke technology and 1.8mm key travel distance improve responsiveness, while 20-million keystroke durability extends longevity.

### ROG Gaming Center

ROG Gaming Center lets you tweak system settings, monitor performance, and customize RGB lighting.

### WiFi

The GL504’s integrated 802.11ac wireless card is hooked up to four antennas, a first for laptops. Our RangeBoost technology monitors these antennas to determine which ones have the best signal and then switches automatically to ensure that you’re using the best pair for the conditions.

### Disappear Into the Action

Near-rimless at a 94% screen-to-body ratio, the QHD display is immersive and deep. High-FPS gameplay is richer with a balance of high-resolution detail, a 165Hz refresh rate, and a 3ms response time. See full-spectrum color accuracy thanks to Pantone® validation and 100% DCI-P3, ideal for gamers who also create. A tall 16:10 aspect ratio expands views, making it easy to keep critical commands in view.​

### Adaptive-Sync Technology

Nothing breaks in-game immersion like stuttering and tearing. GPUs render frames at variable rates, but displays usually refresh at a constant clip, so they frequently get out of sync. With Adaptive-Sync, the refresh rate of the display synchronizes with the GPU’s frame rate to eliminate visual tearing, minimize stuttering, and reduce input lag for gameplay that looks and feels more natural.

### Intelligent Cooling Enables Quiet Power

ROG’s Intelligent Cooling philosophy mixes the right features and settings to ensure the best experience for each chassis. For the Zephyrus M16, liquid metal compound cools the CPU. A customized self-cleaning 2.0 thermal module clears dust to improve long-term stability, while Arc Flow fans are designed to generate impressive airflow with reduced turbulence, ensuring powerful-yet-quiet cooling.

### Sink Into Sublime Sound

Streaming, recording, and gaming are streamlined with the Zephyrus M16’s multi-faceted audio system. Boasting Dolby Atmos® technology, twin tweeters and dual force-canceling woofers, acoustics are beautifully balanced, with Hi-Res certification that supports media at the highest fidelity. A customizable 3D Mic array captures audio in a variety of scenarios, while Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation clarifies sound from your feed and incoming feeds as well.​

### Lighter. Slimmer. More Portable

Game, stream, and code anywhere. Ultrafast Thunderbolt™ 4 lets you connect conveniently on the fly to the latest devices, like powerful external GPUs or docking stations.

### Description

Life is all about finding the right balance, and ASUS E410 delivers just that. Lightweight and compact, it sports a stylish new look that fits right in with your dynamic lifestyle.

With the compact and lightweight ASUS E410, productivity is always within reach. It easily slips into your backpack or small bag so you can get schoolwork done or create content wherever you are.

### Colors that pop

Life is never drab with ASUS E410. Enjoy its unique Peacock Blue or Dreamy White iridescent finishes that appear to change color when viewed from different angles. It’s also available in a subtle and elegant Rose Gold..

### See the difference

ASUS E410 has a youthful vibe that sets it apart. The lid is detailed with modern slashes that are accompanied by a unique motif made up of a deconstructed ASUS badge. The bold look continues inside, where a bright yellow Enterkey takes center stage. It’s something never seen before in laptop design.

### Go for your goals

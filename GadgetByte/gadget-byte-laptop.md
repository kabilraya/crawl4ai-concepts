# Infinix Note 50s
Infinix have lost their minds with this one – the Marine Drift Blue variant has a scented vegan leather back that actually changes fragrance intensity based on how you interact with it. Yeah, you read that right, your phone now has mood-based aromatherapy or something. But setting aside the whole smell-phone weirdness, the specs are actually decent – you’re getting a 6.78-inch 144Hz AMOLED display, MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Ultimate processor, 64MP Sony main camera, and a 5,500mAh battery with 45W charging. Plus it’s IP64 rated and military-grade certified, so at least it won’t break when everyone inevitably wants to sniff it.

# Samsung Galaxy A35 5G
The Samsung Galaxy A35 5G is the company’s 2024 midrange offering. This phone comes with quite a design overhaul from its predecessor — starting with flat edges. The company has swapped out the plastic back for glass while integrating a bump for buttons. On the front, you get a 6.6-inch Super AMOLED screen with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ protection. It also boasts an IP67 rating. Under the hood, you get Samsung’s in-house Exynos 1380 chipset with improved vapor chamber cooling. Other than that, it comes with up to 8GB memory coupled with up to 256GB storage. For software, you get Android 14 with OneUI 6.1 on top. You can enjoy four years of OS updates and five years of security patches on this phone. In the rear, you get a triple camera setup comprising 50MP primary, 8MP ultrawide, and 5MP macro. Samsung has finally ditched the Infinity-U cutout on their midrange devices from this one!

# Google Pixel 7 Pro
Google Pixel 7 was announced at the I/O conference in May 2022 but went on sale only in October. The phone is a more premium offering of the Pixel 7 Pro duo. This is reinforced by Pixel 7 Pro’s bigger, sharper, faster, brighter 6.1-inch QHD+ OLED screen. It also stands out among its vanilla sibling in the camera department which is a key feature of any Pixel phone. Here, you get a third sensor in the 48MP telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom. All in all, the Pixel 7 Pro is the most premium smartphone offering by Google but it is priced considerably higher than its closed sibling.

# Nothing Phone (2)
Nothing Phone (2) is the successor to Phone (1). Characterized mainly by its unique transparent design, Phone (1) was easily the most hyped phone of 2022. The transparent design was complemented with a bunch of LED lights (900 in total) that had custom behaviors depending on ringtone, notification tone, and such. Nothing calls this “Glyph Interface”. Now the Phone (2) improves with things like a more capable Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset, an LTPO display, a more refined Glyph interface, and Nothing OS 2.0. The company promises 3 generations of OS and 4 years of security updates.

# Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE
The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 FE offers a more affordable take on the Z Flip7, retaining much of its core experience while cutting back on a few premium features. It keeps the smaller 3.4-inch cover screen from the Flip6 and uses a slightly older Exynos 2400 chip with 8GB RAM, compared to the Flip7’s Exynos 2500 and 12GB RAM. You also lose Samsung DeX, get a smaller 4,000mAh battery, and fewer color options. However, the main 6.7-inch AMOLED display, camera setup, and Galaxy AI features are nearly identical to the regular model. If you can live without top-tier specs, the Z Flip7 FE delivers almost the same experience at a lower price.

# Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7
The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 stands out with its much larger 4.1″ FlexWindow, now brighter and smoother at 120Hz, alongside a 6.9″ main AMOLED display—the biggest yet in a Flip. It’s thinner and lighter than before, yet more durable with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and a refined hinge. Powered by the 3nm Exynos 2500 chip and 12GB RAM, it now supports Samsung DeX and features AI tools like Gemini Live on the cover screen. While the camera hardware remains similar, enhancements in processing, selfie tools, and a larger 4,300mAh battery make it the most refined Flip phone yet.
